# WiDS-2023 Je ne parle pas fran√ßais

Hello Mentees <br><br>
Welcome to Wids! <br>
In this project, we cover the essentials of Classical Machine Learning or the Pre-Deep Learning era, followed by an introduction to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, and finish by building a simple English to French Translator

## Week-wise distribution of content

1) Quick recap of Python, Gentle Introduction to NLP with word2vec, word embeddings, Distributional semantics
2) Introduction to pytorch and neural networks, convolutional layers and pooling, building CNNs, and training them on dummy datasets
3) Text classification, Language Modeling Introducing attention(Transformer: Attention is All You Need) in encoder-decoders, building a transformer from scratch, Seq2Seq
4) Transfer learning, replacing pre-trained word embeddings in GPT and BERT, and building and training a translator in pytorch from scratch

## Checkpoints

* [ ] Basic assignment to assess your understanding of Python
* [ ] building and training CNNs in pytorch
* [ ] building and training a bayesian classifier
* [ ] building and training BERT and miniGPT in pytorch from scratch

## Week-1

### Resources

To get started with python: https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/index.html

Python and Numpy Tutorial: https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/

<!-- ## Assignment

Python is an essential tool for this project as we will be putting our intuitive thoughts about natural language understanding into logical structures of rules that the computer will perform via python language, this assignment is based on your proficiency in python

### Problem Statement:

You are a given an integer array A of length n, calculate the sum of squares of all the non-negative elements of A.

**You are not allowed to use while loop, for loop, goto statements, and iterators; statements such as the ones given below are not allowed**
* [i*i for i in A]
* sum(A)

**Your program should take the input from a text file and print the output in a separate text file, examples of both of which are given below**

### Input

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T, for each test case the first line contains the length of the array N and the second line contains the space-separated elements of the array

Example input has been provided [here](./assignment/input.txt)

### Output

For each array print the sum of squares of all the non-negative elements of A

Example output has been provided [here](./assignment/output.txt)

### Submission

Provide a link to your submission Python script or Jupyter Notebook in the submission form (The link will be provided soon)

Please go through the 2 documents on Word embeddings and word2vec.
